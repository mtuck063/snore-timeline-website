                    <p class="privacy-intro">Welcome to the Snore Timeline support page. Here you'll find detailed information about how the app works, including snore detection, breathing disruptions, sleep stage classification, and answers to common questions.</p>

                <!-- Getting Started -->
                <div class="privacy-section" id="getting-started">
                    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

                    <h3>How do I use the app?</h3>
                    <p>Snore Timeline is designed to be simple. Open the app and press the record button to begin tracking your sleep sounds. Place your phone on a nightstand about 1-2 feet away from you, ideally plugged in for charging. The app will record throughout the night and process your audio in real-time.</p>

                    <h3>What does the app detect?</h3>
                    <p>The app uses on-device AI to detect and categorize several types of sleep sounds:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Snoring</strong> — The primary focus, detected at frequencies mostly between 50Hz-3kHz. Each detection is marked on the timeline with its volume level.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gasps</strong> — Sudden intake of breath sounds, often associated with breathing disruptions</li>
                        <li><strong>Coughs</strong> — Coughing during sleep, tracked separately from snoring</li>
                        <li><strong>Sleep talking</strong> — Speech, whispers, and babbling sounds</li>
                        <li><strong>Breathing</strong> — Regular breathing patterns used for both disruption detection and sleep stage classification</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All detection happens in real-time using Apple's Sound Analysis framework, running entirely on your device.</p>

                    <h3>Do I need an account?</h3>
                    <p>No. Snore Timeline has no accounts, no logins, and no cloud services. Everything runs locally on your device.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- How Detection Works -->
                <div class="privacy-section" id="how-detection-works">
                    <h2>How Detection Works</h2>

                    <h3>Real-time AI analysis</h3>
                    <p>Unlike apps that sample audio periodically, Snore Timeline analyzes your audio continuously in real-time using Apple's on-device sound classification. Every sound is processed as it happens—no data is skipped or sampled.</p>

                    <h3>Confidence thresholds</h3>
                    <p>The AI assigns a confidence score to each detected sound. The app uses different thresholds depending on the sound type and whether you're actively using the phone or it's running in the background (when you're actually sleeping). This helps reduce false positives while maintaining accuracy.</p>

                    <h3>Decibel measurement</h3>
                    <p>Sounds are measured in decibels (dB SPL), with the app capable of measuring up to 105 dB. Think of it like a volume meter—the higher the number, the louder the sound. The app tracks both peak and average decibel levels for each episode.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Understanding the Timeline -->
                <div class="privacy-section" id="understanding-timeline">
                    <h2>Understanding the Timeline</h2>

                    <h3>Interactive timeline visualization</h3>
                    <p>Your entire night is displayed on a scrollable, zoomable timeline. You can navigate through your sleep session to see exactly when sounds occurred.</p>

                    <h3>Time scales</h3>
                    <p>The timeline supports multiple zoom levels:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1-second intervals</strong> — Most detailed view, each tick represents 1 second</li>
                        <li><strong>5-second intervals</strong> — Detailed view for examining specific episodes</li>
                        <li><strong>1-minute intervals</strong> — Good for reviewing specific periods</li>
                        <li><strong>10-minute intervals</strong> — Overview of sleep patterns</li>
                        <li><strong>1-hour intervals</strong> — Full night at a glance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Hold down the zoom button to quickly zoom all the way in or out—no need to tap multiple times.</p>

                    <h3>Navigating between nights</h3>
                    <p>Swipe left or right on the Nightly Summary screen to move between different nights. The same gesture works on the Weekly Summary screen to navigate between weeks.</p>

                    <h3>Calendar view</h3>
                    <p>Use the calendar to jump directly to any recorded night. Nights with recordings are highlighted so you can easily find your data.</p>

                    <h3>Sleep stage visualization on timeline</h3>
                    <p>If sleep stages were detected, you'll see colored background bands on your timeline indicating which stage you were in at each point during the night. This makes it easy to correlate snoring episodes with specific sleep stages.</p>

                    <h3>Weekly Summary</h3>
                    <p>The Weekly Summary screen shows trends across multiple nights, allowing you to track:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Episode count trends</strong> — See if your snoring is increasing, decreasing, or staying consistent</li>
                        <li><strong>Average volumes</strong> — Track whether your snoring is getting louder or quieter over time</li>
                        <li><strong>Total recording time</strong> — How much sleep you're getting each night</li>
                        <li><strong>Week-over-week comparisons</strong> — Compare the current week to previous weeks</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This helps you identify patterns and see if lifestyle changes (sleep position, weight loss, avoiding alcohol, etc.) are making a difference.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Episodes & Events -->
                <div class="privacy-section" id="episodes">
                    <h2>Episodes & Events</h2>

                    <h3>What is a snore signal?</h3>
                    <p>Every time the app detects a snoring sound, it counts as one "snore signal." More signals means more snoring activity during that period.</p>

                    <h3>What is an episode?</h3>
                    <p>An episode is a group of snore signals that happen close together in time. When the app detects snoring, it creates an episode. If no snoring occurs for 30 seconds, that episode ends. The next time snoring is detected, a new episode begins.</p>

                    <h3>Episode details</h3>
                    <p>Each episode shows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Duration</strong> — How long the episode lasted</li>
                        <li><strong>Snore count</strong> — Total number of snore signals</li>
                        <li><strong>Peak volume</strong> — Loudest moment in decibels</li>
                        <li><strong>Average volume</strong> — Overall loudness level</li>
                        <li><strong>Event breakdown</strong> — Counts of snoring, gasps, coughs, and sleep talking</li>
                        <li><strong>Plain-English summary</strong> — A description like "Heavy snoring for over 20 minutes, with a breathing disruption"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Episode descriptions</h3>
                    <p>The app automatically generates descriptions based on the episode characteristics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Volume levels:</strong> Faint (&lt;40 dB), Light (40-48 dB), Audible (48-56 dB), Heavy (56+ dB)</li>
                        <li><strong>Rhythm patterns:</strong> Rhythmic (consistent intervals), Regular (minor variations), Intermittent (stop-and-start)</li>
                        <li><strong>Trends:</strong> Whether snoring grew louder, faded, or stayed stable over time</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <!-- Breathing Disruptions -->
                <div class="privacy-section" id="breathing-disruptions">
                    <h2>Breathing Disruptions</h2>

                    <h3>What is a breathing disruption?</h3>
                    <p>A breathing disruption is flagged when the app detects a specific pattern: audible breathing followed by extended silence, then a recovery sound. This may indicate pauses in breathing during sleep.</p>

                    <h3>How are they detected?</h3>
                    <p>The detection requires three conditions in sequence:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Baseline breathing</strong> — The app must detect audible breathing sounds for at least one minute before the silent period (11 out of 12 five-second windows must have breathing detected)</li>
                        <li><strong>Extended silence</strong> — A period of complete silence lasting 10 seconds or more</li>
                        <li><strong>Recovery sound</strong> — The silence is broken by a snore signal that is at least 15 dB louder than the average volume during the silent period</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Timeline markers</h3>
                    <p>Breathing disruptions appear as subtle gray-blue markers on your timeline, making it easy to spot patterns throughout the night.</p>

                    <h3>Important disclaimer</h3>
                    <p><strong>This is audio analysis only—not a medical device.</strong> The app cannot diagnose sleep apnea or any other medical condition. It analyzes sound patterns, not blood oxygen levels or brain activity. If you notice frequent breathing disruptions, consider discussing the results with a healthcare professional.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Sleep Stages -->
                <div class="privacy-section" id="sleep-stages">
                    <h2>Sleep Stages</h2>

                    <h3>What are sleep stages?</h3>
                    <p>Sleep Stages is a feature that estimates which sleep stage you're in at any given time throughout the night: Awake, Light Sleep, Deep Sleep, or REM (Rapid Eye Movement). These estimates appear as colored bands on your timeline and as a hypnogram chart in your nightly summary.</p>

                    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                    <p>The app analyzes the regularity and variance of your breathing patterns captured through the microphone. After approximately 15 minutes of recording, the algorithm establishes your personal breathing baseline. It then uses research-based thresholds to classify sleep stages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Deep Sleep</strong> — Steady, regular breathing with low variance</li>
                        <li><strong>REM Sleep</strong> — Irregular breathing patterns with high variance</li>
                        <li><strong>Light Sleep</strong> — Moderate breathing regularity</li>
                        <li><strong>Awake</strong> — Movement, sounds, or breathing patterns inconsistent with sleep</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The algorithm also considers breathing rate, snoring patterns, and time of night. Deep sleep typically occurs early in the night, while REM increases toward morning.</p>

                    <h3>Understanding the hypnogram</h3>
                    <p>The hypnogram is a chart that shows your progression through sleep stages across the night. Each colored band represents 5 minutes in a particular stage:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Orange</strong> — Awake periods</li>
                        <li><strong>Cyan (light blue)</strong> — Light Sleep</li>
                        <li><strong>Indigo (deep blue)</strong> — Deep Sleep</li>
                        <li><strong>Pink/Cyan</strong> — REM Sleep</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can see how many complete sleep cycles you went through, when you had the most deep sleep, and when REM sleep occurred.</p>

                    <h3>Stage distribution</h3>
                    <p>The nightly summary also shows the percentage of time you spent in each stage. A typical night's sleep might look like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>45% Light Sleep</li>
                        <li>20% Deep Sleep</li>
                        <li>27% REM Sleep</li>
                        <li>8% Awake</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These percentages can vary based on age, health, stress levels, and other factors.</p>

                    <h3>How accurate are sleep stage estimates?</h3>
                    <p>Sleep stage detection is based on published research into the relationship between breathing regularity and sleep stages. The estimates provide a useful picture of your general sleep architecture and trends over time. Research using similar audio-based methods has achieved approximately 70% accuracy when validated against polysomnography (clinical sleep studies).</p>
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> These are estimates from audio analysis, not clinical measurements. The app has not been validated against polysomnography and should be treated as estimates, not diagnoses. For clinical sleep analysis, consult a healthcare professional.</p>

                    <h3>Why no sleep stages detected?</h3>
                    <p>Sleep stage detection requires audible breathing throughout the recording. If stages aren't detected:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your breathing may not be audible enough to the microphone</li>
                        <li>The phone may be positioned too far away (try 1-2 feet)</li>
                        <li>Background noise may be interfering with breathing detection</li>
                        <li>The recording may be too short (algorithm needs ~15 minutes to establish baseline)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Storage & Recording Quality</h2>

                    <h3>Recording quality options</h3>
                    <p>Choose the quality level that fits your needs:</p>

                    <h4>Basic (Snore-Focused) — ~8 MB/hour</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Compresses recordings to focus on frequencies below 4,000 Hz</li>
                        <li>Optimized for snoring sounds (50Hz-3kHz)</li>

                    <h4>High Fidelity (Full Detail) — ~25 MB/hour</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Records the full audible spectrum up to 24,000 Hz</li>
                        <li>Preserves all audio detail including room acoustics</li>
                        <li>Uses the most storage space</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Storage management</h3>
                    <p>The app includes options to manage storage:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Storage limit</strong> — Set a maximum amount of storage (1-8 GB) for recordings</li>
                        <li><strong>Auto-trim</strong> — Automatically delete oldest recordings when the limit is reached</li>
                    </ul>

                <!-- Tips for Better Recordings -->
                <div class="privacy-section" id="tips">
                    <h2>Tips for Better Recordings</h2>

                    <h3>Phone placement</h3>
                    <p>Keep your phone about 1-2 feet away from you for best results. Closer means louder detection, but too far away reduces accuracy—especially for capturing breathing sounds, which must be clearly audible to be detected.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ideal setup:</strong> Place your phone on a nightstand near your bed, plugged in for charging.</p>

                    <h3>Battery usage</h3>
                    <p>Snore Timeline is optimized for overnight recording. Most users report 20-30% battery drain over 8 hours. Keeping your phone plugged in ensures uninterrupted recording.</p>

                    <h3>Bluetooth devices</h3>
                    <p>The app supports Bluetooth audio devices including AirPods. However, for best breathing detection, the phone's built-in microphone typically provides more consistent results.</p>

                    <h3>Room environment</h3>
                    <p>For breathing disruption detection and sleep stage classification to work effectively, your regular breathing needs to be audible to the phone's microphone. If you're a very quiet breather or the phone is too far away, breathing sounds may not be detected consistently enough to establish a baseline.</p>

                    <h3>Optimizing for sleep stage detection</h3>
                    <p>To get the most accurate sleep stage estimates:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Consistent placement</strong> — Use the same phone position each night so breathing is detected consistently</li>
                        <li><strong>Quiet room</strong> — Minimize background noise from fans, AC units, or outside traffic</li>
                        <li><strong>Full night recording</strong> — The algorithm improves over time; longer recordings (6+ hours) provide better stage classification</li>
                        <li><strong>Audible breathing</strong> — The phone must be close enough to pick up your breathing sounds clearly (1-2 feet is ideal)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <!-- Troubleshooting -->
                <div class="privacy-section" id="troubleshooting">
                    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

                    <h3>The app didn't record anything</h3>
                    <p>The app only saves audio when it detects sleep-related sounds. If nothing was recorded:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Check that Snore Timeline has microphone permission in Settings > Privacy > Microphone</li>
                        <li>Make sure the phone was close enough to detect sounds (1-2 feet)</li>
                        <li>Ensure the phone wasn't muted or in Do Not Disturb mode that might affect recording</li>
                        <li>You may simply have had a quiet night with minimal snoring</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>No breathing disruptions detected</h3>
                    <p>Breathing disruption detection has strict requirements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your regular breathing must be audible to the phone for at least one minute before the silent period</li>
                        <li>The phone may be too far away to pick up breathing sounds</li>
                        <li>The silence must last at least 10 seconds</li>
                        <li>A recovery sound (snore, gasp) must follow that's significantly louder than the silence</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Detection seems inaccurate</h3>
                    <p>If you're getting too many or too few detections:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Try adjusting phone placement—closer for more sensitivity, further for less</li>
                        <li>Background noise (fans, AC, traffic) can affect detection accuracy</li>
                        <li>The app uses different sensitivity when in the background vs. foreground to reduce false positives from daytime sounds</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Storage is filling up</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Delete old recordings you no longer need from within the app</li>
                        <li>Enable storage limits in settings to automatically manage space</li>
                        <li>Switch to a lower recording quality to reduce file sizes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>App crashed or closed during recording</h3>
                    <p>The app is designed to continue recording in the background. If it stopped unexpectedly:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure Background App Refresh is enabled for Snore Timeline</li>
                        <li>Keep the phone plugged in—iOS may close background apps when battery is low</li>
                        <li>Check that no other apps are competing for audio resources</li>
                    </ul>
